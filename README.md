# ADXL345-RTCDS3231-and-EEPROMAT24C32 STM32L476ZGT6
In this I have a written an application in which I combined the functionalities of ADXL345,RTC and EEPROM and by detecting single tap, RTC preset the time and by double tap, RTC current time stored in EEPROM and whenever STM32 power on/off, EPROM stored time is given to RTC.
