# ADXL345-RTCDS3231-and-EEPROMAT24C32
In this I have a written an application in which I combined the libraries of ADXL345,RTC and EEPROM and by detecting single tap RTC preset the time and by double tap RTC current time stored in EEPROM and whenever power on/off EPROM stored time is giving to RTC.
